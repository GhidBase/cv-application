===================== Notes =============================

Input sections
-General Information (name, email, phone)
-Educational Experience (school name, title of study, and date of study)
-Practical Experience (company name, position title, main responsibilities, date from and until when you worked there)

Edit and submit function for each section, or for the whole CV
Submit should submit your form and display the value of your input fields in HTML elements

Edit button should add back (display) the input fields.
You should be able to edit and resubmit the content.

Create a components directory
Styles directory
Will need to import the CSS files in the component files to use them

====================== Lessons Learned ======================
You have to make sure you're creating a new object when
updating state. no newData = userData

instead do newData = {...userData}

====================== To Do ================================

What's next

Add function

The add function just needs to add a new entry in userData
it needs to
- increment the ID by one
- use the type based on the button pressed (job, education)

I need to create the button
